    <p class="a">I've been working as a computer repair tech for over sixteen years now and I am looking for a change.
    I am looking to switch from hardware to software. Anything technical that doesn't involve a lot of hardware
    repair. Basic skills are front-end web development (css/html & javascript), backend (react) and 
    SQL with MDSS</p>
    
      <p class="b">You can visit me on github and linkedin. I code around 15-16 hours a week. I am currently attending CodeLouisville and 
          I am also self-teaching at my spare time. My main focus at this time is javascript and <br> SQL. I am very dependable and love learning new things.</p>
